# SimpleAccountProtect
Is a Bungeecord / Waterfall / Aegis plugin I made in a few Minutes for Gr1ZzLy#7878.
It checks for the User ``_Gr1ZzLy_`` (yes that's hard-coded, fork & change it if you want to xd) and if the User tries to join compares it to a list of allowed IPs which can be modified in ``AccountProtect/config.yml``.
That's the whole plugin.
